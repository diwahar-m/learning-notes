Algorithms
 - set of instructions

Abstract Data Types 
 - a data wth associated operations of it.
   Ex: array indexing in java.

Space complexity
 - less memory



Linear search 
  - ordinary way based on the length

Binary search
 - for sorted array
 - halfing the length
 - based on starting and ending points

Time complexity 
  - how running time of an algorithm increases with size of input data
