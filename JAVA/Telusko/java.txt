Modifiers:
- if identifier need to be accessible outside the package, make it as public.
- private can be used in same class only. 
- default can be accessed in the same package only.
- protected  can't be accessed in other package .

Polymorphism: ( many behaviour) 
- Compile time 
  - ex: overloading
- Run time
  - ex: overriding 

Dynamic Method Dispatch: 
 - In inheritance , same method all classes, overriding occurs. 

final: 
 - can be used in variables, methods, classes 
 - final makes a method non over ridable. 


Annotations: 
  - supplement to the compiler or run time 
  - passing extra info to compiler or run time.
  - There are annotations for variables, methods, classes
  - Ex: @Override, @Deprecated

Types of Interface:
 - Normal
   - Interface with 2 or more methods
 - Functional/(SAM) 
   - Single Abstract Method  
   - single method
 - Marker
   - blank method
   - Ex: serialization: saving data in hard drive.
   - Ex: deSerialization: retrieving data from hard drive.

Error: 
 - Compile time error 
 - Runtime error :
   - Exception handling
 - Logical error 

Throwable:
1. Error
2. Exception
   1. RuntimeException (unchecked)
   2. SQl Exception - dev needs to handle this.
   3. IO Exception -  dev needs to handle this. 

Threads: 
 - Threads together with mutation is not a good idea.
 - Use 'Thread Safe' if working with mutation 

Thread Safe: 
 - Only one thread works here. 

Thread States: 
 - New 
 - Runnable
 - Running 
 - Waiting 
 - Running 
 - Dead 

Scheduler
 - allows the threads to execute in the OS


Collection: 
 - List
   - ArrayList 
   - Linked list
 - Queue 
   - DeQueue
 - Set
   - HashSet 
   - Linked Hashset

Streams 
 - can be used only once
